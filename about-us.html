            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>To produce a variety of natural, healthy, delicious, and affordable beverages that will satisfy consumers, at a high standard to maintain growth and sustainability. </p>
            
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>LCW Ltd is a business that sells a variety of natural, healthy, delicious, and affordable beverages. It is located in Kingstown, St. Vincent & the Grenadines with two employees and the operating manager Ms. Leonia Wright. It was established in 2016 by supplying beverages for an office event. The beverage was found to be delicious by the staff of the organization and as a result, a demand was created for a weekly supply.</p>
            <p>The owner of LCW Ltd accepted the offer and proceeded to supply the beverages on a weekly basis. The business started out making two (2) beverages and to date has increased to ten (10) beverages with new requests being added from time to time. As the business became more established due to feedback from the staff and word of mouth with those who consume the beverages the need for a full-time operation came into being hence the creation of LCW Ltd. The business strives on using high-quality ingredients produced in an environment that used proper health guidelines and standards at an affordable cost. LCW Ltd.â€™s aim is to please and meet the needs of its consumers.</p>
